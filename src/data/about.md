my_unfinished_story: >
  <p>
  Years ago, when I used to spend most of my evenings riding with my scooter, as I thought I could improve and create better local scooter products, I started my own company selling Tropical signature griptapes and later other scooter pieces. I end up getting my products being sold in a few stores from Barcelona and around it.

  Later on, as I became eligible to go to nightclubs, while I was coursing a mid-degree printed design course, observing the club’s flyers I came up with some ideas to improve them. Doing my own version of an official and professionally executed flyer and getting it posted on the nightclub's social media accounts was freaking awesome for me. Days after that they contacted me for hiring me to work from them doing what I discovered as a passion: Graphic Design.

  Starting my next high-degree course, this time based on Interactive Design, Apple products and software start becoming part of my life, not just as personal devices but as a professional. Then, I realized that I’d like so much the idea of working in a company where you really know everything about it and people around you will enjoy sharing it with you so that’s what I did. I like Apple so I end up working in an Apple Store.

  And for now, that’s my story, but it’s not being ended yet. It will continue to be longer and longer!
