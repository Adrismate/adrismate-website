introduction: |-
  **The main purpose of the project was trying to find a new, better and
  innovative way of improving the dinner experience of a casino. Taking advantage of the emerging new technologies is not just about website or mobile. It's about creating a new experience for your customers. So I decided to create a system which would allow casinos to create an interactive, easy and smart to use with what we are so use to use: touchable controls.**

          I've started with a general research finding references of anything that could help me to develop the product: Microsoft Windows 10 TeamOS, with its great Surface Hub for digital co-working or DigaliX, a company that provides interactive solutions for their clients and they are used to work with large screen media-size projects, for mentioning some.

          Deeper, I did a research of direct and indirect competence for analyzing pros and cons of both no matter its sector. The benefit of doing that is that you don't get closed to the same sector and instead, you have a wider range of what others are doing in different sectors than yours.

          Bearing in mind that the main goal was to make the customer feel comfortable and enjoy a unique experience, the customer’s journey I set was the following:

          Once the customer is registered at the entrance of the casino, a profile is created. When you have a reservation created, you are assigned to a table with the number of registered members. They can freely choose which position on the table to sit in, so on the home screen they will find, among other features, a selector with their names. Otherwise, by default, the system randomly organizes a customer in every corner of the table. It's important that the waiter who accompanies the customers makes it clear that it's crucial for maintaining the experience, that each customer sits on their named positions.

          Continuing, the customer would choose "Drink something" in case of attending without an appointment or “Taste" with appointment.

          Based on this choice, the election process begins by going through different screens, with  categories to choose from Drink, Food and Dessert.

          At the end of the order, it is possible to choose between making a split payment or a single payment and inviting everyone on the table.

          At the time of payment, the customer is rewarded with an amount of credits based on the total spent, to use at the casino. This balance expires on the same day.

          While waiting for the order, the customer can open a series of applications on the entertainment screen. While waiting for your order to arrive you can only choose to order more drinks.

          In first instance, creating the one of the screens with low fidelity in a large piece of paper, really helped me to understand the size that its button should have.

          I found interesting the way neumorphism design makes things pop up and lively, and I thought it would be a good resource to explore more in deep. I got inspired in futuristic colorful interfaces and in some casino mobile games.

          Dark deep blues as the main color palette and a Rajah orange for the accent color, because of the tiger from the movie Aladdin. Tigers represent leadership and dynamism, something that’s very present in gambling.

          Screens are light sources, plus in indoor dark environments, if you want to highlight some content, it’s easier to do it on dark backgrounds providing the user easier-to-find action buttons.

          Once I got a minimum solid interface, I decided to, before getting started on coding, try the UI scale and the accessibility of all the elements on a large screen, a real interactive table.

          With a minimal but solid Design System, it was easier to hand-off all the assets for the development phase. While it just required a basic functional prototype, I coded the main screen for selecting meals which is the same for both drinks and desserts so I put more effort on the UX/UI phases.

          I want to mention how easy and eye-catching was to create the neumorphism effect with a box-shadow containing two shadows, each positioned opposite from the other, creating that pop or deep effect.

          Thanks to this project, I got more involved in components, and code-like features with the design tool Figma as well as more ways for setting CSS components in a quicker and more scalable way.

In conclusion, the dinner experience in restoration has seen various changes in the last years. Clearly, nowadays, we are seeing more and more restaurants implementing these technologies.
However, only few restaurants have begun to taking advantage of this kind of technologies in their dining rooms, either because it’s expensive to implement or because the public isn’t prepared yet.
