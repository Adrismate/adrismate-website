introduction: |
  **In this project, I designed the visual identity, created several graphic applications, and developed a comprehensive style guide for the Next Wave Today brand. This tech startup aims to promote and implement learning about both current and emerging technologies for everyone. I also had the privilege of collaborating with Albert González, a renowned Creative Director known for his work in photography and video, throughout this journey.**

          To kick off the project, we conducted several brand strategy and brainstorming sessions. Since the client had already provided the brand name, we worked from a base that included a concept map, a list of keywords, three user personas, and, in that order, the brand’s personality and values.

          **“Let’s make it human”** — this idea came up during the competitive analysis. The competition was aggressive and overwhelming, generating a lot of noise. To break away from that, we decided to shift our approach by placing the user at the center of our decisions.

          With a focus on proposing a diffusion strategy, meaning a brand message strong enough to stand out in the market, a SWOT analysis was conducted.

          Once fundamentals were established, I’ve started developing three different visual directions with different core values. “Empowering Tomorrow’s Minds” in warm orange tones, was selected as the rule concept for the rest of the project. Logotypes are always a crucial part of a brand identity project since multiple values are arranged in one single symbol. Part of the challenge was the 3 words of the naming getting mixed together with it. But not impossible.

          The movement of waves in all their forms, not just as a liquid, but also how they form, behave in different environments, and exist in other states, was studied to gain a deeper understanding of the abstract nature, part of the idea behind the phrase “next wave today”.

          We worked with abstract forms, exploring interesting shapes – wavy and curved rather than straight lines.

          The design took an innovative turn, seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence into our daily lives. This integration made it more relatable, personal, and accessible, eliminating the feeling of complexity or distance and bringing the future into the present.

          Color and typography were combined to represent wind and marine energy, which are still evident in the abstract and meticulously shaped forms of the rocks, maintaining that energetic wave. The warm yet vibrant orange, complemented by the horizon blue, along with the more neutral secondary colors, were carefully selected to represent the fusion of technology with extraordinary arid landscapes, brimming with energy.

          Next, you can find the remaining steps, including how the logotype appears in its various versions and how it’s relevant to both the real and digital worlds.

          With the final logo concept formalized, we conducted a responsive study to ensure it displayed well at any size and across all mediums, whether on paper or digital screens. As seen, the central axis lines posed a problem when the logo was significantly reduced, so an adaptation was made to prevent unwanted effects.

          Since the logo was built on a solid foundation of principles, its evolution into the final form allowed us to create an animated version (video) for a seamless and natural presentation.

          As part of the process, we also developed a social media kit for Instagram and X (Twitter). This included a series of templates for posts and a static version for stories, with an animated variant that allows for flexible information placement in a continuous loop. Profile pictures and headers for social media were also included.
