introduction: |
  **In this project, I developed the visual identity, various graphic applications, and a style guide for Next Wave Today, a tech start-up focused on promoting and implementing learning around both current and emerging technologies for everyone. I had the honor of collaborating with Albert González, a Creative Director renowned for his work in photography and video.**

          To kick off the project, we held several brainstorming sessions. Naming was not part of this project, as it had already been established, so we worked from a base that included a concept map, a list of keywords, 3 user personas, and, in that order, the definition of the brand’s personality and values.
          *[screenshots to illustrate this process - pendientes de crear]*
          “Let’s make it human” — this idea came up during the competitive analysis. The competition is aggressive and anxious, creating a lot of noise. We decided to break away from that by placing people at the center and flipping the approach entirely.
          With a focus on proposing a diffusion strategy, meaning a brand message strong enough to stand out in the market, we created a SWOT analysis.

          Once this phase was completed, we developed three different graphic directions for the client to choose from for the rest of the project.

          “Empowering Tomorrow’s Minds” was selected as the guiding concept for the project’s development. Since the goal was to create a strong logo that communicated the brand's values as well as those implied in the naming, we studied the movement of waves in all their forms — not just as a liquid, but how they form, behave in various environments, and in what other states they exist.

          We worked with abstract forms, exploring interesting shapes that aligned with concepts of phases, waves, and curved rather than straight lines.
          The design takes an innovative direction, bringing the future into the present, much like how artificial intelligence is integrated into everyday life — making it more approachable, personal, and accessible, without feeling overly complex or distant.
          Color and typography were combined to represent wind and marine energy, still present in the abstract and meticulously shaped forms of the rocks, maintaining that energetic wave. The warm yet vibrant orange, accented with horizon blue, along with the more neutral secondary colors, were carefully selected to represent the fusion of technology with extraordinary arid landscapes, filled with energy.

          With the final logo concept formalized, we conducted a responsive study to ensure it displayed well at any size and across all mediums, whether on paper or digital screens. As seen, the central axis lines posed a problem when the logo was significantly reduced, so an adaptation was made to prevent unwanted effects.
          Since the logo was built on a solid foundation of principles, its evolution into the final form allowed us to create an animated version (video) for a seamless and natural presentation.
          As part of the process, we also developed a social media kit for Instagram and X (Twitter). This included a series of templates for posts and a static version for stories, with an animated variant that allows for flexible information placement in a continuous loop. Profile pictures and headers for social media were also included.
